Exercise 4: Time series plot - all diseases in the United States

1.	Compute the US rate by using summarize to sum over states. Call the variable rate.
2.	The US rate for each disease will be the total number of cases divided by the total population. 
3.	Remember to convert to cases per 10,000.
4.	You will need to filter for !is.na(population) to get all the data.
5.	Plot each disease in a different color.


library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dslabs)
library(RColorBrewer)
data(us_contagious_diseases)

us_contagious_diseases %>% 
filter(!is.na(population)) %>% 
  group_by(year, disease) %>%
  summarize(rate = sum(count)/sum(population)*10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, rate, color=disease)) + 
  geom_line()
